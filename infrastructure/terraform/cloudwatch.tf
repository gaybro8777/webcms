# CloudWatch dashboards
#
# The structure of a CloudWatch dashboard is relatively simple. A dashboard is modeled as
# a grid of widgets, positioned on abstract X/Y coordinates. The dashboards in this file
# follow a 4x4 layout. Each widget is the same size - 6x6 abstract units. On a 1920x1080
# monitor, this comes out to a widget that is 407x290, with the chart area being 387x270.
# The downside to this is that the fourth row of widgets is off the screen when using
# Firefox, so we should relegate the fourth row to smaller elements.
#
# The rows and columns of each dashboard are, vaguely, ordered like so:
# * Each column represents its own set of metrics (for example, EC2 instances or database
#   latencies). There is no particular order to the columns in a dashboard.
# * The rows are ordered roughly in terms of relevance to overall application health. For
#   instance, in the overview dashboard, the load balancer's target health metrics are
#   placed above the response times.
#
# For each dashboard, there is a dashboard_body argument that is a serialized JSON object
# representing the dashboard's widgets. Each widget has the following properties:
# * `type`: indicating the widget type - metrics, text, logs, etc.
# * `x`: the absolute x-position of the widget
# * `y`: the absolute y-position of the widget
# * `width`: the width of the widget
# * `height`: the height of the widget
# * `properties`: the actual widget contents
# * `annotations`: chart annotations/callouts
#
# Chart annotations are relatively simple:
# * `annotations.horizontal`: an array of annotation objects for horizontal (Y axis-based)
#   annotations
# * `annotations.vertical`: an array of annotation objects for vertical (X axis-based)
#   annotations
#
# An annotation object has `color`, `label`, and `value` properties.
#
# The `properties` object varies by the kind of widget. We document the `"widget"` type
# here:
# * `properties.metrics`: the metric(s) being displayed by this widget
# * `properties.view`: the kind of view (time series, stacked, etc.)
# * `properties.region`: the AWS region being graphed
# * `properties.title`: the display title of the widget
# * `properties.period`: the period, in seconds, being displayed (usually this is 300 - 5
#   minutes)
# * `properties.stat`: the computed statistic for the metric (e.g., average, percentile,
#   min/max)
#
# The `metrics` field is a list of JSON arrays. Roughly, the structure is as follows:
# ```
# metric ::= [
#   "<MetricNamespace>", "<MetricName>",
#   "<DimensionName_1>", "<DimensionValue_1>", ..., "<DimensionName_N>", "<DimensionValue_N>",
#   { <MetricOptions> }?
# ]
# metrics ::= [ <metric_1>, ..., <metric_N> ]
# ```
#
# CloudWatch dashboards use two special string values to indicate repetition:
# * `"."`: Repeat the single string from the prior array
# * `"..."`: Repeat the _entire_ metric from the prior array
#
# The `"."` marker is used often when a metric varies only by dimension, or shares a
# namespace. The below example reports two metrics from the same namespace:
# ```
# metrics = [
#  ["AWS/Foo", "MetricOne"],
#  [".",       "MetricTwo"],
# ]
# ```
#
# The `"..."` marker is used primarily when reporting on a different statistic for the
# same metric. The below example reports the `"SomeMetric"` metric's average and 95th
# percentile in the same widget:
# ```
# metrics = [
#   ["AWS/Foo", "SomeMetric", "SomeDimension", "AnotherDimension", { "stat": "Average" }],
#   ["...",                                                        { "stat": "p95" }    ],
# ]
# ```

  # Color code: secondary metric (this is CloudWatch's orange color)

  # * Other advice: When combining this and the dashboard-color-unhealthy code, make sure
  #   that the two statistics can be distinguished by something other than color alone.
  #   For example, it is a bad idea to use this color when comparing healthy to unhealthy
  #   hosts, as the values may switch positions. However, it _is_ useful when comparing
  #   percentiles, as it is guaranteed that the 10th percentile is less than or equal to
  #   the 95th percentile. (The stats can be distinguished by their order from top to
  #   bottom in the chart.)

  # * Use: as a callout color to indicate high latency/potentially negative circumstances
  #   (for example, unhealthy hosts or high tail latency).
  # * Other advice: When showing good/bad (see, e.g., the load balancer health widget),
  #   use dashboard-color-primary as the "good" value since it plays better with red/green
  #   colorblindness.
